<p>What is Comic Learning?</p>

<p>My intention of this blog is to record all insteresting NLP techniques and Machine Learning algorithms. I am currently working on a NLP research project with a professor in my university. I wanted to share the exciting knowledge that I am learning and turn the abstract explainations for Machine Learning into comics or drawings that everyone will be able to understand. This blog is aimed for both people who are genuinely curious about the Machine Learning algorithms and those who are advanced in the field and looking for more perspectives.</p>

<p>I hope my comics will make you giggle and ponder occasionally. If you are new to Artificial Intelligence, I hope this blog will incite your passion in Machine Learning just like the how I was watching my first ML lecture.</p>

<p>Great thanks to Andrew Ng’s Cousera course and Google’s Deep Learning on Udacity which introduced me to the field.</p>

<p>And thanks for XKCD for inspiring my idea for “comicfying” ML concepts
